# Cloud benefits

## Overview
In this module you will learn about what benefits Cloud technologies offer.

### Scaling in/out

Scaling in and out is a reference to your services automatically reacting to the amount of work they need to do and if 
the resources available are not enough to automatically get more, once the workload decreases the resources are 
released as well.

* Scale Out
    * Cope with spikes in demand (expected and unexpected)
    * Scale out from zero, for batch processing
* Scale in
    * In response to lower demand
    * Automatically based on time of day (peak hours)
    * Lower costs
In the picture below we can see how there is always just a bit more computational power than the demand requires. Also 
based on the amount of users coming to the service there is an increase in the resources required, once the peak time is
 over then the resources are released.

### Cloud provider competencies

Another major benefit is allowing customers to take advantage of the competencies of the cloud service provider. 
* Operating a Data centre is complex and many costs and issues need to be considered:
    * Security, certifications, audits
    * Hardware specifications, warranties, installation, disposal
    * Operating Systems and platform licenses
    * Network configuration and security
    * Software has to be self managed
    
### High availability

Running an application in a variety of physical locations was previous so expensive that only the largest organisation 
could really consider it, and usually only for the most critical of functionality. With the cloud, the idea of High 
Availability is essentially free:
* Same cost to deploy to multiple data centres
* Fewer single points of failure
* Lower latency, high availability

### Agility

Using the cloud tends to increase agility. We’ll see many case studies, later on in this course, where faster 
time-to-market was one of the major benefits of an organisation’s move to the cloud. Faster provisioning for (e.g.) 
new projects. Faster introduction of new services:
* In DevOps for example; agile creation, testing and deploying of services
* Continuous Delivery/Deployment
